# Burger Clicker

## Description
Burger Clicker is an idle/incremental game inspired by the classic Cookie Clicker and was made with React, Tone JS, and Chart JS. It is currently incomplete but still playable. If I come back to this project in the future, I'll add more store items and upgrades, a working achievement system, more minigames, better UI etc.

## How to play
- Click the big burger to earn burger currency
- Use this currency to purchase upgrades (workers, factories etc) to automate burger production
- Once you have two or more workers, you can play a burger assembly minigame to earn burger currency even faster, or you can just idle and let the burgers roll in
