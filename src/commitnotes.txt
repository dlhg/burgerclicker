 Commit Notes

Wed Nov 22
- added more pointer power upgrades to upgrade store
- removed rows of buildings from main game area
- updated storeitem component to use formatNumberTruncated as long strings were taking up too much space and pushing burger emoji to new line
- removed word "multiplier" when boost active to avoid text taking up a new line
- updated handleClick function burger component so the player can only click the burger once every 50ms. This prevents autoclicker from breaking the game, but is somewhat of a bandaid fix.
    - ideally the game should be able to handle really fast autoclicking and would smoothly update burgercount
    - right now it seems the async nature of state updates is causing the count to get updated in irregular chunks whenever fast autoclicking is active
- started working on legacy/prestige
